# Kunstmaan - SnippetJS

## Goal

* Provide some small re-usable javascript code snippets that can be used in a variety of javascript projects.
* Idea is that you just import (es6) the code snippet(s) you need and bundle it yourself with the rest of your project code (vs. having to include a 'large' concatenated/minified bundle where you may only need a small part of)
